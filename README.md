# ExamCreator
This program is created to read the exam questions, choices, and answers from a file. You may choose any file to have the program read them, but make sure that the file follows the format. The format goes as follows: All numbers are questions, all lowercased letters are choices, and all uppercased letters are answers. The drivingtest.txt file is a sample of how it follows the format.
